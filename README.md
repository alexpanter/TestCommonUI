# Attempt at creating a better UI system with Common UI plugin

Thanks to Patterson for writing a nice guide for the keyboard navigation [here](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/B5R6/unreal-engine-common-ui-plugin-keyboard-navigation).
It makes the keyboard arrow inputs behave like joystick buttons in that they can hover correctly render hover/unhover.

Also big thanks to Nicolae (Xelu) Berbece for providing the icons for keyboard/controller key logos ("Content/UI/ButtonIcons"). Full credits are included in `ButtonIcons_Readme.txt`.

## How to download

This project is set up with Git LFS, as a measure against uploading large asset files to git. For this reason, the "Clone -> Download ZIP" unfortunately doesn't work as it does not properly download the LFS files.
The safest way is through git command-line:
```
git clone git@github.com:alexpanter/TestCommonUI.git
```

NOTE: This project has only been tested with Unreal 5.4.
